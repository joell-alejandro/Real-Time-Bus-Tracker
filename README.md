# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

A demonstration using a database provided by the state of Massachusetts that tracks all the bus stops from MIT to Harvard.

# How to run

You do not need any special software to run, although Google Chrome is recommended. If you'd like to edit the code an editor is needed such as VS Code.

# Roadmap of future improvements

I plan on trying to implement this where I am at locally in California.
